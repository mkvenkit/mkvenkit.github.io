# Papyr 

![Papyr](images/embedded/papyr.jpg)

With the exploding number of connected devices being deployed, power consumption is a major concern. Technologies like BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) are built from the ground up with low power consumption in mind. Another technology which is extremely low power is the e-paper display, which was made famous by its adoption by Amazon for the Kindle devices. Papyr from Electronut labs combines these two core ideas - a low power wireless technology combined with a low power display system. By choosing the Nordic nRF52840 SoC, Papyr is able to support not only BLE but mesh networking protocols like Thread, BLE Mesh, and Zigbee. Papyr has many extras too - like build in NFC antenna for BLE pairing or Thread commisioning, CR2477 battery holder, micro USB port, extra GPIOs, RGB LED, etc. There are a lot of applications possible with Papyr - dynamic price tags, for example, or sensor data display in a mesh network. Papyr can be used anywhere you need a low power, connected display.

# Blip 

![Blip](images/embedded/blip.jpg)

Blip is a development board for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and 802.15.4 based wireless applications, based on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 SoC. It has a Black Magic Probe compatible programmer and debugger built in, along with temperature/humidity sensor, ambient light intensity sensor, and a 3-axis accelerometer. It can be used to prototype very low power devices. It also has provision for an SD card slot, which makes it a complete and versatile development board.

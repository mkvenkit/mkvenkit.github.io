  Electronut Labs started as a blog on Electronics and Programming. After a long career in the software 
        industry, Mahesh Venkitachalam wanted to return to his childhood interest in building electronic gadgets. 
        The projects and articles in the blog gained in popularity, culminating in a book with elements of 
        programming and hardware (Python Playground, No Starch Press).

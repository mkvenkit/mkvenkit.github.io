## Introduction

I've been programming since 1992 (Turbo C, anyone?) - initially on traditional computers, and more recently on those amazing tiny devices called microcontrollers. Whether I was drawing graphics on screen,
talking to the internet, or communicating with external sensors, my code was ultmately running on "fixed function" hardware designed to do one specific thing. FPGAS are a differemt story. These "magical devices" (apologies to Prophet Jobs) are programmable.
